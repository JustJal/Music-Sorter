# Music Sorter
 This program helps you to sort your music by Artist > Album.

# Recomendations
Please make a backup of your music before using my program (I do not have responsability on data loss). If you encounter bugs or problems using it, please make an issue with the explanation of the bug you found and I'll patch it as soon as possible.

# Using

After initializing the program, Copy and Paste the Root Directory where your music is. It will only read Music on that directory, that means, if you have music on subfolders, those will not be sorted.
